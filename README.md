This is a project for investigating the use of [Angular Grid](http://www.angulargrid.com/index.html)

I've used the [healthy-gulp-angular](https://github.com/paislee/healthy-gulp-angular) again

## Installation


(The original healthy-gulp-angular README can be found here: [healthy-angular-README.md](original/healthy-angular-README.md) )


## Running the app

`$ gulp watch-dev`
